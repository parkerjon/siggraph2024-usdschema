# siggraph2024-usdschema
Example USD applied schema for NAIF SPICE transformations.

This USD schema is codeless and does not need to be compiled.  See the OpenUSD information page here:

https://openusd.org/release/tut_generating_new_schema.html

This is an as-is production tool and has not been generalized for wide use, so some AMNH-specific declarations are still in-place.
